# MaskClassifier-LinearSVC
This is a LinearSVC that classifies if a human face has a mask on or no, with additional "Social Credit" system

This is a quick project and an ok start to getting familiar with computer vision.

The LinearSVC was trained on the Face-Mask-Detection kaggle dataset of Debargha Mitra Roy which is under the MIT license.
